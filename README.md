# Termfolio

Hey, this is my portfolio project with a Terminal like theme.
Feel free to copy it and use it!

## How to:

Run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

To use the developer mode.

When doing a copy of the project, after pushing your changes run:

This will create a new branch for Github Pages
